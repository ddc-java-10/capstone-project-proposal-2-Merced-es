# Budget Manager

An Android app that helps groups of people manage and track their spending. Users will create categories for bills, gas, groceries, dining out, miscellaneous, personal spend, savings, and any other categories of their choosing. Personal and group savings goals can also be created for any duration of time.
Each user in the group will enter all transactions made on a daily basis. Bills can be entered and split up between the members of the group according to whatever is agreed upon. The due dates and any notes can be entered for each bill for organizational purposes. Budgets can be made for categories like dining out and personal spend. The app will send notifications to a user when they have spent half of their budget and again when they have spent 3/4 so they can rethink their spending depending on how far along they are in the month.
